# DataCleaningPortfolio

**Project Description**:
This data analyst portfolio project centred on the comprehensive data cleaning and transformation of Nashville housing data. The primary goal was to standardise and optimise the dataset to prepare it for more in-depth analysis. The project encompassed various data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to ensure data quality and consistency.

**My Role**:
I implemented a series of data cleaning and transformation procedures. These procedures addressed issues such as date format standardisation, populating missing property addresses, splitting address fields into separate components, normalising "SoldAsVacant" values, and removing duplicate records. My role required meticulous attention to detail and a thorough understanding of data cleansing techniques.

**Key Achievements**:

1. **Date Format Standardisation**: I standardised date formats within the dataset to ensure uniformity and consistency, making it easier to analyse time-series data.
2. **Address Enhancement**: I populated missing property addresses by leveraging data within the same dataset, significantly improving the completeness of the dataset for future analyses.
3. **Address Field Splitting**: I split property addresses into individual components, including the street address and city, facilitating more granular geographic analyses.
4. **Owner Address Normalisation**: I normalised owner addresses by splitting them into separate fields for address, city, and state, enhancing data consistency and usability.
5. **Categorical Data Transformation**: I transformed "SoldAsVacant" values from 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No,' improving the interpretability of this categorical variable.
6. **Duplicate Record Removal**: I identified and removed duplicate records based on various key attributes, ensuring the dataset's integrity and eliminating redundancy.

**Technologies/Tools Used**:

- SQL: To execute data cleaning and transformation queries.
- Azure Data Studio: For database management and querying, creating views, temporary tables, and performing data transformations.

**Notable Outcomes/Results**:

- The project resulted in a significantly cleaner and more standardised dataset, which is now primed for more advanced analytics and modelling.
- Data inconsistencies and gaps, such as missing property addresses, were effectively addressed, enhancing the dataset's usability for location-based analyses.
- The transformation of owner addresses and "SoldAsVacant" values improved data quality and made the dataset more accessible for future users and analysts.
- Removal of duplicate records eliminated potential sources of bias or errors in analyses, ensuring data accuracy and reliability.

Overall, this data cleaning project demonstrated my skills in data preprocessing and transformation techniques, setting the stage for more in-depth analyses and insights into the Nashville housing market.
